== Introduction

https://github.com/wfouche/Tulip[Tulip] is an advanced open-source software tool designed for load testing, stress testing and performance regression testing. It serves as a robust solution for evaluating the performance and stability of web applications under varying conditions, ensuring they can handle high traffic and stress levels efficiently. Similar to well-known tools like JMeter, Gatling and Locust, Tulip provides powerful capabilities to simulate real-world scenarios and generate comprehensive reports, helping developers identify and resolve potential bottlenecks.
