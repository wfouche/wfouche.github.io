== Introduction

https://github.com/wfouche/Tulip[Tulip] is an advanced open-source software tool, written in Kotlin for the JVM, designed for load testing, stress testing and performance regression testing. It is a robust solution for evaluating the performance and stability of web applications under varying conditions, ensuring they can handle high traffic and stress levels efficiently. Similar to well-known tools like JMeter, Gatling and Locust, Tulip provides powerful capabilities to simulate real-world scenarios and generate comprehensive reports, helping developers identify and resolve potential bottlenecks.

Tulip is available as a runtime JAR on Maven Central. A benchmark program is consists of three parts:

. JSONC benchmark configuration file specifying benchmark scenarios
. User class that implement actions to be benchmarked
. App class that activates the Tulip runtime

== Quick Start Guide

The best and quickest way to get started with Tulip is to try out the sample benchmark program.

Prerequisites::
* OpenJDK 21 or later version is installed
* https://www.jbang.dev/[JBang] 0.121.0 or later version is installed
* [optional] Scala-cli is installed to run the Scala sample benchmark program
* Tulip has been tested and works on Linux, Windows or MacOS

Run the following command to create the Kotlin version of the sample benchmark program:

`jbang io.github.wfouche.tulip:tulip-runtime:2.1.3 Kotlin`

[NOTE]
====
The sample benchmark program is implemented in four languages:

* Java
* Groovy
* Kotlin
* Scala

For example, to generate the Java version of the benchmark program simply run command:

`jbang io.github.wfouche.tulip:tulip-runtime:2.1.3 Java`
====

Thereafter start script `./run_bench.sh` (Linux or MacOS) or `.\run_bench.cmd` (Windows).

While the benchmark program is running the `benchmark_output.json` file is incrementally updated with benchmark results, and once benchmark is finished a benchmark report is generated from the benchmark output.

The benchmark report file is called `benchmark_report.html`
